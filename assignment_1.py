# find x and y from below sequence 10,1,8,3,6,5,4,7,x,y
x = 10
y = 1
while x >= 1:
    print(x, ',',  y,  end="")
    x = x-2
    y = y+2

# Algorithm for Finding X and Y
# 1. Set x=10 and y=1
# 2. Loop if X is greater than or eqqual to 1
# 2.1. Print X and Y while decrementing 2 from X and incrementing 2 from y
# 3. Loop will stop when x becomes 0
